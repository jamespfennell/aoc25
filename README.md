# Advent of Code 2025

Problem inputs are stored in `data/day<N>.txt`. Not in source control per Advent of Code policy.

To calculate the solution for e.g. day 3 problem 1:

```
zig run main.zig -- 3 1
```

To run the tests for a day (which verifies the example in the problem statement and the actual solution):

```
zig test day3.zig
```
